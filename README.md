# Alzheimers-Disease-Predictive-Modeling-R
Exploring Alzheimer's Disease: Analyzing demographics, cognition, and socio-economic data to identify diagnostic markers and inform intervention.

## 1. INTRODUCTION
<p align="justify">
The aim of this report is to investigate the relationship between various characteristics of 
individuals and their diagnosis as either Alzheimer's (Demented) or not (Nondemented). 
By analyzing a dataset containing demographic, cognitive, and socio-economic factors, we 
aim to understand the factors associated with Alzheimer's disease and its diagnosis. The 
report utilizes descriptive statistics, clustering, logistic regression, and feature selection 
techniques to gain insights into the relationship between these characteristics and the 
diagnosis. The findings will contribute to our understanding of the disease and inform 
potential interventions.
